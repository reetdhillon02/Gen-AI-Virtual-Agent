Problem Statement:
The Dance academy currently relies on traditional helpdesk methods to address inquiries and provide information to students and potential customers. This process is often time-consuming, lacks scalability, and may not be available round the clock to cater to diverse needs. Additionally, managing inquiries manually can lead to inconsistencies in responses and potential delays in addressing customer queries. There is a need for an automated solution that can efficiently handle inquiries, provide accurate information, and enhance user experience while reducing the burden on human resources.


Goal Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop an LLM-powered chatbot tailored specifically for the Dance academy to streamline customer interactions, improve accessibility to information, and enhance overall user satisfaction. The ultimate objective is to create a seamless and intuitive user experience that enhances engagement, reduces workload on staff, and promotes the academy's services effectively.
